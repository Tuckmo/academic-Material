# Academic-Material Theme

This is a modified version of the [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which instead of using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) that the original version uses, this one uses [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)

To install please follow the instructions for the original [Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) theme. In the config file of your Hugo project you will have to use theme = "academicMaterial" instead.
